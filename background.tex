\chapter{Background}
In preparation for this project, I have done some background
reading. I looked for discussions of similar projects and for research about design and implementation of intelligent agents. 

\section{Similar Projects}
A similar project is a study of recreational river boats using
traffic simulation software \cite{Lowry2011}. This was looking at a
different problem, the amount of traffic passing through various parts
of a river at given times, and so their approach of using VISSIM is
not appropriate to this project. For instance, they could safely
separate the river into two lanes of unidirectional traffic (and the
vast majority of traffic was floating downstream) and they used a
particularly simple overtaking model. The VISSIM driver model is also
a stochastic model while the aim of this project is to develop
intelligent agents whose behaviour model can be inspected for rules to
follow. However, the domain being studied was
similar. In particular they discuss the difficulties of calibrating
their simulation given limited resources and how to infer guesses
about useful information based on the limited data that could be
collected. They also provide some ideas about how to get hold of data
in order to model the topology of a river (unfortunately it would
appear that extracting it from an OS map is the best available
technique).

\section{Related Research}
Related research mostly fell into three areas: research into control mechanisms for
autonomous agents and discussions of design strategies and frameworks for simulating
and visualizing multi-agent systems.
