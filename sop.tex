\chapter{Statement of Problem}

Before implementation can begin some time should be taken to carefully define the problem.

\section{Issues facing a cox}
The cox has many issues to deal with in the course of an outing. These have been split into to types. There are issues external to the crew and there are issues internal to the crew

\subsection{External Issues}
\begin{itemize}
  
  \item{Navigation} The cox controls the rudder and dictates the power applied by each rower and so it is his responsibility to steer a path along the river.
  
  \item{Congestion} As well as avoiding static obstacles, the cox will also have to contend with other river users who may get in his way. The Cam is a very small river with a large number of rowers so dealing with congestion is a common problem.
  
  \item{Safety} The cox is responsible for the safety of the boat and crew because he is the person in charge of the boat's speed and direction and the one person looking forward in the boat. It is the cox's responsibility that the boat does not collide with any obstacles that may cause damage to any people or equipment on the river.
  
  \item{Covering distance} A crew will gain very little from an outing if they only travel a short distance at a slow speed. Often a coach will supply the crew with an outing plan that will dictate how fast and how far the crew should travel during the outing. The cox should ensure that the crew's actual activity matches the outing plan as closely as possible.
  
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Internal Issues}
\begin{itemize}
  \item{Indirect Control} Unlike a car where the driver can directly adjust speed with the accelerator pedal, a cox can only request that the rowers apply more or less pressure. It is the rowers themselves who must make these changes. Even if these requests are followed only they can only specify very rough changes in pressure applied which in turn means speed can only be altered in hard-to-predict jumps.
  
  \item{Physiological Constraints} Each rower is a human and so there are complex physiological (and psychological) constraints that will limit how quickly the rowers can accelerate the boat and how long they can maintain a particular speed.
\end{itemize}
