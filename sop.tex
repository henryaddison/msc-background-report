\chapter{Statement of Problem}

Before implementation can begin some time should be taken to carefully define the problem.

\section{Issues facing a cox}
The cox has many issues to deal with in the course of an outing. These have been split into two types - external issues that place physical constraints on where the boat should be and internal issues that may affect the effect of actions taken by a cox. For the most part this project will look at having autonomous coxes learn to deal with the external issues and not worry too much about the complications that the internal issues may introduce.

\subsection{External Issues}
\begin{itemize}
  
  \item{Navigation} The cox controls the rudder and dictates the power applied by each rower and so it is his responsibility to steer a path along the river.
  
  \item{Congestion} As well as avoiding static obstacles, the cox will also have to contend with other river users who may get in his way. The Cam is a very small river with a large number of rowers so dealing with congestion is a common problem.
  
  \item{Safety} The cox is responsible for the safety of the boat and crew because he is the person in charge of the boat's speed and direction and the one person looking forward in the boat. It is the cox's responsibility that the boat does not collide with any obstacles that may cause damage to any people or equipment on the river.
  
  \item{Covering distance} A crew will gain very little from an outing if they only travel a short distance at a slow speed. Often a coach will supply the crew with an outing plan that will dictate how fast and how far the crew should travel during the outing. The cox should ensure that the crew's actual activity matches the outing plan as closely as possible.
  
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Internal Issues}
\begin{itemize}
  \item{Indirect Control} Unlike a car where the driver can directly adjust speed with the accelerator pedal, a cox can only request that the rowers apply more or less pressure. It is the rowers themselves who must make these changes. Even if these requests are followed only they can only specify very rough changes in pressure applied which in turn means speed can only be altered in hard-to-predict jumps.
  
  \item{Physiological Constraints} Each rower is a human and so there are complex physiological (and psychological) constraints that will limit how quickly the rowers can accelerate the boat and how long they can maintain a particular speed.
\end{itemize}


\section{Questions that simulation could help answer}

As presented in the Introduction the aim of a simulation of conditions on the river Cam is to try and answer the question ``What should an inexperienced cox try to do?" There are also other questions that may be of interest that perhaps the simulation could help address.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What is the pattern of traffic on the river? Why does it get busy in certain parts of the parts at certain times? Could adjustments in cox behaviour improve traffic flow?
  \item Could adjustments to cox behaviour improve safety on the river?
  \item \label{CoopQ} Should individual coxes behave selfishly or would co-operation with other coxes help in the long run (even at the expense of occasional self-sacrifice)?
  \item \label{CommQ} Could communication between coxes be used to improve quality of outings for crews?
\end{enumerate}

It would be interesting to follow up some of these questions as well during the project, particularly questions \ref{CoopQ} and \ref{CommQ}.

\section{Objects in Universe}

To make it feasible to create a simulation the model must simplify the real world. The first simplification is to restrict what objects shall be modelled. For the purposes of this project there are four main types of object to consider: the river, boats, outing plans and coxes. 

\subsection{River}
The vast majority of rowing on the Cam takes places on a 5km stretch of river between Jesus Lock and Baits Bite Lock. Some crews do carry their boats over Baits Bite Lock to another stretch of river up to Bottisham lock. The boathouses used by rowers are clustered near Jesus Lock.  This stretch of the Cam has been known to flood but for the most part it is static and its stream has no effect on boats. 

\subsubsection{Simplifications}
A crew carrying their boat over Baits Bite Lock happens infrequently enough that it can safely be ignored.
The boathouses are sufficiently close together and near Jesus Lock that it is reasonable to merge the boathouses into one. 
Outside of race days and a brief period early in the year when novice crews take to the water, the short stretch of water from Christ's boathouse (the last in the row) to Jesus Lock is rarely used and so it seems reasonable to treat this merged boathouse as one end point of the river rather than Jesus Lock.
